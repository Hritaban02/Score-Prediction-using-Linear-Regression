# Score-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Using a Simple Linear Regression model, we predict the scores of a student based on the number of hours he/she studies per day.

In a simple linear regression, we try to fit a line of the form Y = mX + b to the data using the ordinary least squares method. We also look at the r-squared and adjusted r-squared as a metric of evaluation.
